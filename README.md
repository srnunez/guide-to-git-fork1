## Webpage
Visit our website [here](https://sophia-nunez.github.io/guide-to-git/) to read about Git and various use cases. Our guide is 
designed for beginners, especially students working on projects for the first time. 

### Sections
The **Basics** section will introduce git and the basic commands you need to know, whether you're working solo or in a group.
The **Intermediate** section covers commands and topics not needed as a beginner, but that you may begin seeing as you use Git more often.
The **Advanced** section is made for more complicated topics, such as branches and various merge conflicts.

We also have a **Troubleshooting** section focused on navigating situations when things go wrong. If you ever run into issues with file changes, check here for more information.

Our last section is the Exercises tab. Check out this page for practice scenarios. Work on handling merge conflicts and forking repos using our tutorials - if you ever get stuck, each scenario has an associated solution for you to check out!
